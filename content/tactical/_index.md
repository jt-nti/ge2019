So many tactical voting sites, so little time!

Before you even start thinking about _who_ to vote for, make sure you _can_ vote!

Have you registered? Excellent, now grab a drink and take a few minutes to check out which tactical voting tool makes most sense in your constituency. Don't worry too much yet, most are still being updated. If you're unsure, look out for recommendations from your local groups.

And remember, if you've registered to vote, make sure you _use_ your vote!
